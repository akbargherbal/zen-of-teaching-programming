### **The Zen Rules of Excellent Teaching – Project-Based Edition**

#### 1. The Designer's Mind

**A destination, not a map. A riddle, not a recipe.**

_Instead of giving a checklist of functions to write, present a problem to be solved. Let the student grapple with the design. The struggle to create the map is where the deepest learning happens. They will remember the path they forged themselves far longer than the one you drew for them._

#### 2. The Path to Wisdom

**The good path illuminates the great one.**

*Don't just show the perfect, idiomatic solution. First, walk a simpler, more obvious path. Then, reveal the more elegant way and explain the wisdom behind the choice. This teaches not just a solution, but the critical judgment to select the *best* solution.*

#### 3. The Living Code

**Code is clay, not crystal. Let them see your hands shape it.**

_Never present code as a finished, perfect artifact. Write it live. Make mistakes. Pause, reflect out loud, and refactor a messy section into a clean one. This shows that writing code is an iterative process of molding and improving, not a fragile act of perfection._

#### 4. The Virtuous Flaw

**To teach strength, first show a flaw. A test that fails is a lesson that succeeds.**

_The most powerful way to teach the value of testing is to let a test catch a bug. Intentionally leave a small, understandable flaw in your code. Later, guide the student to write a test that exposes it. The moment the test fails is the moment its true purpose is revealed._

#### 5. The Gentle Ascent

**A mountain is climbed one step at a time. So too is a program built.**

_A complex project can feel impossible from the bottom. Break the journey into small, manageable steps. Ensure that after each step, the student has a working, tangible result. Confidence is built from a series of small, successful ascents, not one giant leap._

#### 6. The Unburdened Mind

**The mind is a cup. To fill it, pour slowly.**

_When introducing a powerful new concept—like a testing framework or an advanced library—resist the urge to show all its features at once. Introduce one idea, let it settle, and let the student use it. Introduce the next only when the first is understood. A half-full cup is more useful than one that is overflowing._
